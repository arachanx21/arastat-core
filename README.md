ARA Applied Potentiostat Core. A library to control the DAC for potentiostat. Our potentiostat approach design utilises differential amplifier in which the voltage applied from digital-to-analog converter would be subtracted with a reference voltage.

Feel free to use or modify it depending on your case.
